# Hi, stranger... on my page..

## I’m @mtdowner!

I'm unsure how to pronounce that.. so you can call me Missy for short.

👩🏻‍💻 I am super duper new to web development, and I'm learning everything on my own. With the help of some awesome resources, of course. But still, just between you, me, and my resume, I'm learning allll by myself! And for free, too.

🪦 At 30 years old, I have decided to completely change my career (lol what career?) and take up something I know very little bit about. But hey, have you seen the kind of cash you could be rolling around in?

🎒 If you're still here, feel free to join one of my classes I put together or check out my Coda document full of free ways to learn web development and programming. That being said, if you have any tutorials you would like feedback on, I'd be happy to help with that :).
