👋 Hi, I’m @mtdowner, but I'm unsure how to pronounce that.. so you can call me Missy for short. 
- 👀 Anyhoot: I am super duper new to web development, and I'm learning everything on my own. With the help of some awesome resources, of course. But still, I'm learning allll by myself!
- 🌱 At 30 years old, I have decided to  ryk up  currently learning how to code for my organization's website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy projects/tutorials so I can gain experience using GitHub, because I am often confused!
