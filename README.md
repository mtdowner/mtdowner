- 👋 Hi, I’m @mtdowner, but you can call me Missy. I'm not even sure how you would pronounce that. 
- 👀 Anyhoot: I am a very new beginner just beginning to learn web development. Allllll by myself! 😁
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code for my organization's website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy projects/tutorials so I can gain experience using GitHub, because I am often confused!
