- 👋 Hi, I’m @mtdowner, but you can call me Missy.
- 👀 I’m a very new beginner just beginning web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code for my organization's website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy projects/tutorials so I can gain experience using GitHub, because I am often confused!
